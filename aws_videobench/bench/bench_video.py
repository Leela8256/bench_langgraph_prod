"""RocketRide VIDEO batch driver — sizing runs (adapted from aws_bench/bench/rr_driver.py).

Same record schema and response-unwrapping as the PDF driver; differences:
  - corpus is *.avi; per-doc audio duration joined from corpus_manifest.json,
    so throughput can be quoted as MEETING-MINUTES PER SECOND (x realtime),
    the unit that answers "how long will N hours of footage take".
  - default mode is blast (ONE send_files batch — RocketRide's native path).
  - this is a SIZING run, not a gated benchmark: no envelope, single rep,
    the R5 whisper nondeterminism finding stands and is irrelevant here.

RR_TRACE=metadata|summary|full turns on per-node timing from the engine's own
apaevt_flow events (off by default — the control for a traced run is this same
driver with RR_TRACE unset). Output: flow_events.jsonl + node_timings.json,
and trace_level/flow_ops_seen/node_timings in shot_meta. See flow_selftime.py
for why the numbers are EXCLUSIVE self time and not leave-minus-enter.
