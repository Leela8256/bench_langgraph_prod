"""EXCLUSIVE per-node self time from the engine's own apaevt_flow traces.

Two things bite anyone who reads apaevt_flow naively. Both were learned the
hard way on the PDF arm (aws_bench, 2026-09-21) and both are worse here.

  (1) DURATIONS NEST. The engine drives the whole downstream chain
      synchronously inside the upstream node's lane call, so on the video pipe
      frame_grabber_1 CONTAINS detect_1 contains preprocessor_1 contains
      embedding_1 contains response_1 -- depth 5. A raw leave-minus-enter total
      is therefore INCLUSIVE and will always indict the outermost node, which
      is the one node that is certainly not the problem. What names the
      expensive node is EXCLUSIVE self time: a frame's duration minus the time
      spent inside the frames nested in it. That is what this module computes.

  (2) LANE CALLS ARE NOT DOCUMENTS. A node receives several enter/leave pairs
      per item (PDF parse_1: ~11 per document). Every count here is `calls`,
      never `documents`, and nothing divides by the document count.

Timing basis: no apaevt_flow event carries a clock, so the CLIENT stamps
arrival. Websocket delivery latency is common-mode on one socket and cancels
in a leave-minus-enter difference; jitter does not. Read the shape, not the
third digit.

Pairing is by (pipe id, component) as the observability doc requires --
"pair enter/leave by identity (component), not stack position" -- with a
per-pipe frame stack so nesting is measurable rather than assumed.

Module use (bench_video.py):
    from flow_selftime import summarize_flow
    summary = summarize_flow(flow_raw, t0_ns, span_s)
