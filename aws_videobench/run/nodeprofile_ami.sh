# NODE-LEVEL ATTRIBUTION on the AMI VIDEO corpus, BOTH ARMS — the video-track
# twin of aws_bench/run/nodeprofile.sh.
#
# The question: where does each arm's per-video time actually go, node by node,
# on the same videos, in the posture a user gets without tuning anything?
#
#   cell rr-traced   RocketRide, N videos, blast, RR_TRACE=summary
#                    -> the engine's own apaevt_flow enter/leave events, one
#                       pair per component, written to flow_events.jsonl.
#   cell rr-control  RocketRide, the SAME videos, same mode, RR_TRACE UNSET
#                    -> the perturbation control (see below). Nothing else
#                       differs between this cell and rr-traced.
#   cell lg          LangGraph, the same videos, c32
#                    -> per-node timings are already recorded on EVERY video
#                       (lg_timings: frames_s / detect_s / chunk_s / embed_s,
#                       arms/langgraph/graph.py), so LangGraph needs no tracing
#                       switch and has no perturbation to control for. Its
#                       assemble stage is NOT timed — an asymmetry the
#                       comparison states rather than hides.
#   cell rr-seq      RocketRide, 6 hand-picked videos ONE AT A TIME, traced
#                    -> per-VIDEO node attribution. apaevt_flow carries no file
#                       identity, so the only way to say WHICH video a node
#                       spent its time on is to have exactly one video in
#                       flight: in seq mode every flow event falls inside one
#                       video's [submit_ns, completion_ns] window on the same
#                       clock. Blast cannot do this, at any trace level.
#
# WHY THE CONTROL IS NOT OPTIONAL
#   Tracing rides the same websocket the driver measures on, and the engine
#   does extra work to emit it. If tracing moves throughput, the traced cell
#   describes a DIFFERENT run from the one we are trying to explain. So
#   rr-traced is compared against rr-control on x_realtime, frames_per_s and
#   cpu_s_per_frame (plus effective_cores for context), and any delta over 5%
#   is flagged: past that the node shares are indicative only and must never
#   be quoted as the untraced baseline's breakdown.
#
# POSTURE DISCLOSURE — BOTH ARMS UNTUNED, exactly as every prior AMI run
#   RocketRide  ONE pipeline, no `threads` argument (RR_THREADS unset), the six
#               BLAS/OMP vars UNSET (the plain `rocketride` service, never
#               `rocketride-matched`), blast ingestion, UNPINNED.
#   LangGraph   ONE uvicorn process on 8200 (the plain `langgraph` service),
#               c32 client concurrency, UNPINNED.
#   No cpuset envelope on either arm; one arm at a time; single rep. This is a
#   DEFAULT-POSTURE ATTRIBUTION STUDY. It is not the matched campaign and its
#   cross-arm numbers are not a matched comparison. The keepalive busy loop
#   (below) burns ~1 core on the box for the campaign's whole lifetime and is
#   part of the disclosed conditions, as in every campaign in this repo.
#
# NESTING CAVEAT — READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING ANY NODE NUMBER
#   RocketRide drives the whole downstream chain synchronously inside the
#   upstream node's lane call, so apaevt_flow spans NEST: on the detect pipe
#   frame_grabber_1 contains detect_1 contains preprocessor_1 contains
#   embedding_1 contains response_1. A raw leave-minus-enter total is therefore
#   INCLUSIVE and always indicts the outermost node — the one node that is
#   certainly not the problem.
#   >>> NEVER quote a raw leave-minus-enter number. In node_timings.json that
#   >>> is the `inclusive_total_s` column; it is kept only so the trap stays
#   >>> visible in the artifact.
#   bench/flow_selftime.py subtracts the nested children and reports EXCLUSIVE
#   SELF TIME; `total_s` and `pct_of_node_time` are the quotable figures, and
#   bench_video.py already routes node_timings.json through the same function.
#   `pct_of_span` is NOT a fraction of the run: with C items in flight the node
#   totals sum to roughly C x span and it can exceed 100.
#   Prefer the flow_selftime.py CLI output over node_timings.json: it adds the
#   LangGraph join and, for seq runs, the per-video table.
#
# SEQ-CELL COVERAGE — a known, disclosed limit of the cross-arm join
#   The bulk cells measure the FIRST N of ami_full in sorted order (N=24 ->
#   EN2001a..ES2003d). The seq six are chosen for ROOM-TYPE DIVERSITY, and four
#   of them (IN1007, IN1016, ES2016d, TS3009c) are nowhere near the first 24.
#   flow_selftime.py restricts a seq-mode --lg join to documents ok in BOTH
#   runs, so `rr-seq --lg lg` covers only EN2001a and ES2002a. The seq cell's
#   own per-video RocketRide table is complete and unaffected. To get all six
#   on both arms add the optional cell: CELLS="... lg-seq" (LangGraph seq over
#   the same curated corpus); it is OFF by default because it is not one of the
#   four decided cells.
#
# COST at the defaults (N=24 -> 19.57 h of footage, 24 measured + 2 warm):
#   rr-traced ~33 min, rr-control ~33 min (RR measured 36x realtime on blast),
#   lg ~8 min (LG measured 150x), rr-seq: 4.62 h of footage but ONE video at a
#   time, which exercises far less of a 32-core box than blast — 4.62h/36x is
#   a floor (~8 min), not an estimate. Plus image builds on a cold box.
