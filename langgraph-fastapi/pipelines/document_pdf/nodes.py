"""Thin graph nodes. Each calls ONE workload function and returns only its
own state update plus its timings_ns entry.

Nodes are PLAIN SYNC FUNCTIONS on purpose: LangGraph's async runtime
dispatches sync nodes to its default executor, keeping CPU-bound work off
the event loop. This is the documented pattern for compute nodes — the
PDF-1K run demonstrated what happens otherwise (async nodes calling sync
compute serialized every request through the loop and the server drowned
under concurrent load). No executor sizing, no max_concurrency: defaults.

No reformatting, no rounding, no reordering — whatever the workload returns
is what lands in state and, ultimately, in the response.
